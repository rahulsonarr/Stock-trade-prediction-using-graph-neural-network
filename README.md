# Stock Trade Recommendations using Graph Neural Network
This repository contains the code implementation for the Stock Trade Recommendations system using Graph Neural Network (GNN). The system utilizes the power of GNNs to analyze interconnected financial data and generate accurate trade recommendations.

# Features
Graph construction: The financial data is transformed into a graph, capturing the relationships between different stocks, market trends, and other relevant factors.
Graph Neural Network: The GNN model is designed to effectively learn from the graph and extract meaningful features for trade recommendations.
Training and evaluation: The model is trained using historical stock data and evaluated on real-world financial datasets to measure its performance and accuracy.
Visualization and explanation: The system provides visualization tools to understand the underlying patterns and dynamics in the financial data, aiding in decision-making and interpretation of the recommendations.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib

# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/rahulsonarr/Stock-trade-recommendations-using-graph-neural-network.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd rahulsonarr/Stock-trade-recommendations-using-graph-neural-network
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook stock_trade_recommendations.ipynb in Google Colab or any compatible environment.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the knowledge graph, train the GNN model, and generate trade recommendations.
Customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training settings as per your requirements.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and visualization tools provided.
Experiment with different datasets, time periods, and feature combinations to further enhance the system's performance.

# Results
The results of the experiments conducted using the Stock Trade Recommendations system demonstrate its effectiveness in generating accurate trade recommendations. The model outperforms traditional benchmark models in terms of average return and other evaluation metrics. The visualizations and explanations provided offer insights into the underlying factors influencing the recommendations, aiding in decision-making and risk management.
